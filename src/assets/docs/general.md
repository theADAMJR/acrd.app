# General

## Auto Roles
Roles automatically given to a member upon joining the server.
For example, if `@Member` and `@Special Snowflake` was an auto role, then the member 
would automatically be given both roles.

[!] Avoid giving an auto role, administrator permissions.
## Ignored Channels
The channels where command execution is ignored.
For example, if `#general` was ignored, `/ping` would not work in that `#general`.

## Prefix
The characters preceding a command.
For example, `/ping` -> prefix is `/` as it precedes the command name.
